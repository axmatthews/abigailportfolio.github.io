      <h1>THE STACK</h1>
      <p> A digital philosopher and sociologist Benjamin Bratton, published the book â€œThe Stack: On software and Sovereignty (MIT Press, 2015). The computational metaphor of the Stack, explains the substantial layers of computation such as smart grids, mobile apps, automation etc. that are evolving and forming as a whole. <br> We interact with the Stack but we are also a part of the Stack. <br> The stack involves six layers, these include user, interface, address, city, cloud and earth. The layers operate from top to bottom, naturally beginning with the user interaction. </p>

    <div class="layer one" id="section2">
      <div class="btn btn-user" id="section2"> USER </div> 

    <div class="user-text"> The user layer can be known as the agent, the position that provides the illusion of control. As the user, we believe they are calling the shots, although the Stack is responsible for these. As we see the Stack, the Stack also recognises us - our digital movements.</div>

    <div class="layer two" id="section3">
      <div class="btn btn-interface"> INTERFACE </div> 

    <div class="interface-text"> The interface layer is the layer that connects users and the technical layers below. This layer allows for interaction, it can connect and route user actions through unseen column and sequence. </div>
    <div class="link"><a href="#section4">3</a></div>     
    </div>

    <div class="layer three" id="section4">
      <div class="btn btn-address"> ADDRESS </div> 

    <div class="address-text"> The address layer is a system that any matter is potentially identified by a universal addressing system. In which positions can be mapped and identified. It is almost a virtual geographic, where things can be traced, connected and designated.  </div>
    <div class="link"><a href="#section5">4</a></div>      
    </div>


    <div class="layer four" id="section5">
      <div class="btn btn-city"> CITY </div> 

    <div class="city-text"> The city layer is the architecture and construction of the Stack, sporting users in transit. It is populated with an Internet of Things (IoT) and is often watching, moving, taking and reporting data. The city yields and stores information. </div>
    <div class="link"><a href="#section6">5</a></div>    
    </div>

    <div class="layer five" id="section6">
      <div class="btn btn-cloud"> CLOUD </div> 

    <div class="cloud-text"> The cloud layer is as we know it. They are built onto or bypass the internet, it is a large single form of a discontinuous overarching computer. It is the most powerful layer in the Stack and has gained interest in corporate global internet companies.  </div>
    <div class="link"><a href="#section7">6</a></div>     
    </div>


    <div class="layer six" id="section7">
      <div class="btn btn-earth"> EARTH </div> 

    <div class="earth-text"> The final layer earth, after going through the Stack and the experience in which we gained as a user we reach this earth layer itself. The outcome can be in a number of different forms as well.
